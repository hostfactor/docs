Host Factor will no longer be supporting a free tier due to cost.

## Console commands

Host Factor now supports all console commands for Terraria and Factorio. The console commands
(like the server configuration) are accessible through a simple interface, so you don't have to
search for docs and dig through code.

If you hold a subscription, you have access to these right now. If you're currently on the free tier,
you will have to upgrade to gain access to this feature. Speaking of which...

## Free tier suspension

Starting immediately, Host Factor will no longer be supporting free servers. This means if you are currently
using a free server you cannot update its settings or start it. All future users will no longer be able to create
free servers.

### Save files
All current free tier holders still have read-access to their filesystem to allow you to download your files.
I currently have a lifecycle policy of **90 days** so make sure to download your saves before then.

### Background

A couple of months ago, I began to receive a massive spike in users (about 10x). The increase in traffic was very
cool to see, but it also came with a significantly higher cloud bill. Surprisingly offering servers for free
is not a very sustainable business model which means I'm really left with no choice but to suspend the free tier.

Before you ask about ads, know that I tried that and can dig into it deeper on Twitter/Medium if enough are interested.


Thanks all!
