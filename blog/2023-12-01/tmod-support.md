Host Factor now supports TMod servers for Terraria

<BlogImage src={'/img/blog/tmod-support/header.png'}/>

<!--truncate-->

Host Factor now fully supports [TMod](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader) (by popular demand). TMod allows for simple yet expressive modding for
a Terraria server and offers a wide ecosystem of mods that can be installed through the Steam workshop. Like
all Host Factor servers, we went above and beyond to offer the best possible support for TMod.

For example, we offer a searchable database of the most popular mods

You can also manually enter the Workshop ID of any mod into the dropdown if you're using less popular mods.

We also keep your server up to date with the latest version of TMod (which changes pretty frequently)

Let me know on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/hf_eddie) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/TCkKNVAnEF) if you have
any issues or suggestions! Thanks everyone.
