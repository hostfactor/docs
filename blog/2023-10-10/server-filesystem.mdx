Host Factor now supports realtime file access

<!--truncate-->

All servers now support **read access** to their files **while running**. You no longer need to contact
support if you want to take a look at a file within your server. To see the files:

1. Start your server in your [dashboard](https://hostfactor.io/dashboard)
2. Click on your server
3. Click on the `Files` button in the side panel
4. After the server starts, click the `Server disk` tab

You can also look at individual files. Simply click one of the files

Now that users can access their server's files, this opens the door for creating/editing as well. Ideally,
the Host Factor platform becomes so user-friendly and simple that there is rarely, if ever, a need to do this.
I've never heard of any mobile app that requires you to create/edit/read files to work properly and I think
server apps should be no different.

Nonetheless, the platform now supports it, and I'm very happy with how it turned out.

Let me know on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/hf_eddie) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/TCkKNVAnEF) if you have
any issues or suggestions! Thanks everyone.
