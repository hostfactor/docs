Due to some much-needed optimizations, Host Factor now offers extremely (maybe cheapest) pricing for hosting.

<!--truncate-->

Host Factor now supports some of the cheapest hosting options in the world. This is all enabled due to some major
enhancements to our proxy layer which makes running things like `standby mode` incredibly cheap and efficient.

### Updated prices ü§ë {#updated-prices}

All 3 paid tiers are now offered at:
* `Basic` ($4.99/month)
  * Now offers `standby mode`
* `Plus` ($8.99/month)
  * Now offers Discord notifications
* `Premium` ($14.99/month)

You can see the [pricing page](https://hostfactor.io/pricing) for more details. If you currently have a sub, your
pricing has been adjusted automatically for you.

### Free tier CPU üê¢ {#free-tier-cpu}
In the last few weeks, Host Factor has seen some pretty explosive growth. This has been incredibly exciting as well
as revealing. Prior to the large increase in users, scaling didn't appear to be a problem, but it's become all-to apparent
in the last few weeks.

This sudden increase in cost means we're no longer able to offer users the same level of CPU speed for free, so I've
decided to reduce the speed for all free tier machines. All paid users still have the fastest CPUs we can muster so
please consider purchasing a sub if you want a much speedier machine!

### Multi-currency support üí∞{#multi-currency-support}
Host Factor now accepts multiple currencies! We added support for the following:

* GBP
* EUR
* CAD
* MXN
* INR
* PHP
* ARS
* BRL
* COP
* PEN
* CLP

The pricing for all of these currencies has been scaled to the buying power of the users in the countries in which
the currency is used.

Thanks all!
