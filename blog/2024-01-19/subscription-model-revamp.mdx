Host Factor now supports a simpler and cheaper subscription model

<BlogImage src={'/img/blog/subscription-model-revamp/banner.png'}/>

<!--truncate-->

Host Factor now supports the industry-standard `good, better, best` subscription model. This allows us to bundle our individual
products into packages and offer them for cheaper than we would individually. It's also far simpler to manage on the backend
meaning fewer bugs üêõ.

### Offerings

We currently offer 4 tiers:
* `Free`
* `Basic` ($7.99/month)
* `Plus` ($14.99/month)
* `Premium` ($23.99/month)

You can see the [pricing page](https://hostfactor.io/pricing) for more details.

### Legacy subscriptions
If you already had a subscription under the legacy system, then nothing will change. You still have the same legacy pricing and
products as before. If you want to update your subscription however, you must do so under the new subscription model.


Thanks everyone!
