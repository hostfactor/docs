## Goodbye
Hey all, just letting you know that Host Factor will be closing its cyber doors. All live subscriptions
will expire at the end of their current term. This means no game server will be functional after **May 31, 2024**.

## Downloading saves
All save files have a **90-day** expiration from their creation. If you want to keep your save files, you must download them before
then or before your server expires, or they'll be permanently removed.

## But why? üòø
I've been working on Host Factor for 3.5 years and I really haven't been able to make the progress that I've wanted.
It has been a lot of fun and work, but at this point I want to stop iterating on what I know and pick up something new.
Starting a company from scratch (even a tiny one) can be an emotional roller coaster but the lessons have been invaluable.
I started working on Host Factor after having the idea to host Factorio servers incredibly cheaply by leveraging Kubernetes
and a custom controller. This was successful but that opened so many other doors for optimizations and possible features.
Reminds me of the programmer's credo:
