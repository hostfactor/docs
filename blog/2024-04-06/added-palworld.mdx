Host Factor now supports Palworld for all subscription tiers.

<BlogImage src={'/img/blog/added-palworld/banner.png'}/>

<!--truncate-->

Host Factor now supports [Palworld](https://hostfactor.io/apps/palworld) a very fun survival
game that looks nothing like Pok√©mon. It's available for all tiers but suggested for at least the
Plus plan.

I really wanted to support Palworld for everyone, so I decided to bump the memory capacity for
all subscription tiers by 2GB. This means the Basic plan can support Palworld but not for a
large save. Enjoy the free memory everyone!

Let me know on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/hf_eddie) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/TCkKNVAnEF) if you have
any issues or suggestions! Thanks everyone.
