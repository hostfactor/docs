This static configuration was nice as a start but became limiting very quickly.\\n\\nFor example, in Terraria users can configure to use a server with TShock or Vanilla. TShock servers would allow\\nfor mods while Vanilla would not. TShock also has additional config to be applied. This variation became a big\\nproblem because it meant users are not able to use plain old Vanilla Terraria servers (which is very common).\\n\\nTo address this, I\'ve given Blueprint Providers (small services that create apps for you to choose in Host Factor)\\nthe ability to provide multistep and realtime forms when updating/creating a new server. If you take the above case,\\nafter selecting Terraria, users are shown the `Server type` screen\\n\\n![Server type](/img/blog/expressive-config/server-type.png)\\n\\nWhen a user selects `Vanilla` they\'ll be shown the baseline server configuration options as opposed to the large\\namount of options that TShock offers.\\n\\n![Vanilla config](/img/blog/expressive-config/vanilla-config.png)\\n\\nNow Blueprint Providers have lots of expressive ways to present configuration to users. What\'s better is each provider\\ncan configure their forms with just a YAML file and a method implementation for realtime feedback. This makes it \\ntrivial for Host Factor to add more streamlined and expressive config options in the future.\\n\\n## Terraria updates\\n\\nBecause of the above changes, Host Factor is now able to support Vanilla and Mobile servers for Terraria."}]}')}}]);
